# FIFA19_Kaggle-analysis
FIFA19 players' data analysis, written in python. Using Keras for prediction and some common python packages like seaborn and pyechart for visualization.   

## Requirments
Python 3.6, tested on conda environment on Windows.  
### Required packages
Keras, tensorflow, numpy, pandas, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib, pyechart and wordCloud.  
It's important to note that you should install echart on your PC and then use the command "pip install pyechart" in your conda environment. Concretely, open the anaconda prompt and get into the conda environment, and then write the command as above which definitely works. (You can use other methods, but do not directly use "conda install pyechart".)
## Datasets
Datasets are downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19
